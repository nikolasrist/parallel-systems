In the Makefile you may choose between three different compilers. The
Makefile as it is uses the GNU compiler gcc. To switch to another
compiler comment the two lines for the GNU compiler with a "#" in the
first column and uncomment the two lines for the compiler you want to
use.

You must load once a session the appropriate compiler module, e.g.,
- module load gcc
- module load intel-compiler
- module load pgi

and do a "module load libFHBRS"


You may add additional compiler flags in the line with the appropriate
CFLAGS for the chosen compiler.


Do the following commands to run a test after you changed something:
    make clean; make run

"make clean" is necessary to force a recompilation of all files
(e.g. if you switched to another compiler).


Source files:
- main.c: driver program (initialization, prefix call, time measurements)
- prefix.h: type definitions
- prefix.c: implementation of prefix operation

You may change source code only in prefix.c!
