Do once a session "module load gcc openmpi/gnu libFHBRS"


This is a template directory for your MPI program in assignment 1.

Name your source file ring.c (prototype available) and call "make" to compile your program.

Then run your program with the batch script "sbatch job_mpi.sh".

The program follows these steps:

1. Each process initialises MPI and needed variables.
2. The Master fills his vector with his number at position 0 and send it to process 1.
3. Each middle process fills the vector at his specific position in the vector and sends it to the next process.
4. The last vector adds his number and sends the filled vector to the first process 0.
5. The process 0 checks the somes of the whole vector and an addition of all numbers between 1 and the number of processes.
6. If both sums are equal the run is successful.
